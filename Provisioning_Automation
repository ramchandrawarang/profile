1. Read the IGF file in xls or xlsx format only. if format is other than xls or xlsx its failed (.csv also will not work).
2. Upload file to CMDB.
3. Start the automation execution.
4. Phase1 
    Execute new_provision.py
    Read log file - will get the ILO ip and mac.
    Curl on ip and get the SN and update CMDB.
    Read CMDB records and check RFP.
    Compare SN , make, model, cpu type (internal disk , NIC in lator stage if possible).
    -If hardware profile mismatch then stop that mismatched execution only and ask user to provide input to overwrite the further process or not.
    Make ILO ip static, create user.
    Apply IRS - if there HW issue it will log ticket with HP.
    -Cheking firmware if update available then update the tested firmware. chek HP site for updated firmware if avilable the download it and install that.
    
5. Phase 2
    Data ip allocation/validation:
    User has to update ILO VLAN configuration on the switch and update ILO DHCP server to serve the planed subnet.
    The subnet info should be available in t_subnet table and in t_ipstatus and ther should be the free ip to alocate.
    Need to think on how to get the new subnet info into t_subnet and replicate into t_ipstatus table and update DHCp server.
    For RAID configuration we need some info from user before.
    Build ISO image with driver.
    - network connectivity
    - will move discovery into after ILO config 
    - save xml file to server (switch info)
    - RAID configuration. (RFA)
    - Need to enable PXE for 10gig nic card (will only for 560 + SPF model).(we cant use pxe because pxe not enable on all model 10Gig card)
    - Till this all steps same for linux, windows, esxi.
    - The automation should work with linux, windows, esxi os without any human intervention. 
    - For Linux
        Creating kikstart file from table.
        Create ISO image 38MB size per m/c and start OS installation.
    - For ESXI
        its working.
    - For Windows
        Pending task - We have to buld solution for Windows.
        (need to add story in taiga for windows baremetal provisioning.)
    
    We need to discuss about image repository
    (under hardik lead we have to do start to end linux and esxi os baremetal provisioning without human intervention.)    
    (Under ashutosh lead we have to do hetrogeneous start to end baremetal provisioning without human intervention.)
